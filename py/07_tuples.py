# coordinates = (10,20)
# person = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")
# single_item = (42,) #Note the comma for single item 

# Tuple operations
# print(coordinates[0]) # Accessing elements
# print(len(person))   # Length of tuple

# Check to see what type it is:
# x = (10, 20, 30)
# print(type(x))

# Checking immutability of tuples:
# groceries = ("oats", "milk", "eggs", "bananas")
# groceries[0] = "bread"  # This will raise a TypeError since tuples are immutable
# # print(type(groceries))
